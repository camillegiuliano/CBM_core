## Overview

[CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) is the central module of [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git). This is where all the carbon transfers are calculated at every time step, where disturbances are applied, and stocks are tracked. It cannot run on its own and it needs parameters from either [CBM_defaults](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_defaults.git), [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git), and [CBM_vol2biomass_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_vol2biomass_SK.git) (as per the provided example for managed forests of Saskatchewan) or the equivalent information from the user. In *SpaDES-speak*, this module has five events (`Init`, `spinup`, `annual`, `accumulateResults`, and `plot`). Only in two of these events do carbon transactions occur: `spinup` and `annual`. The other events are tools to enable these transactions. All events are scheduled only once except for the `annual` event, who schedules itself until the end of the simulation horizon. Only in this module are the Python functions from the [libcbm](https://github.com/cat-cfs/libcbm_py/tree/main) package called. The functions used in this module are the [libcbm cbm-exn](https://github.com/cat-cfs/libcbm_py/tree/main/libcbm/model/cbm_exn) functions exclusively, as these were designed to accept external biomass increments. These Python functions are used in the `spinup` and in the `annual` events only.

## Background

In [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git), the approach described in our [Overview](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/index.html#order-of-operations) section is applied. Parameters are easily accessible via normal R-functions, and the SpaDES toolkit enables a modular, repeatable continuous workflow. This brings the transparency and flexibility needed for scientists to modify, evaluate and test new inputs, new data, and new algorithms while permitting non-researcher users to also use the system.

## Module functioning

### Events
There are 5 events in CBM_core. Each are run once, except for the `annual` event, which is repeated for each simulation year. 

#### `Init`
In this short event, the Python virtual environment is set up. If a suitable version of python is not available, it will be installed using the `reticulate` package. 

#### `spinup`
The main goal of this event is to initialize the landscape by performing the [spinup function](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/#the-spinup-function).

Cohort and stand data is prepared and passed to the [`cbmExnSpinup`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core/blob/cf9c966e7bbbb29f8089411c73d030e21846ffe3/R/spinup.R#L5) function alongside growth curve data (from CBM_vol2biomass_SK) and spinup default data (from CBM_defaults). The [`cbmExnSpinup`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core/blob/cf9c966e7bbbb29f8089411c73d030e21846ffe3/R/spinup.R#L5) function sets up inputs, calls the [`cbm_exn_get_default_parameters`](https://cat-cfs.github.io/libcbm_py/cbm_exn_custom_ops.html#Appendix-1:-CBM-EXN-Default-parameters) python function that defines the model structure, and runs the carbon transfers necessary for the growth and burn cycle using [`cbm_exn_spinup`](https://cat-cfs.github.io/libcbm_py/cbm_exn_custom_ops.html#Appendix-1:-CBM-EXN-Default-parameters).

The spinup output data and cohort groups are then prepared for use in the `annual` event. 

#### `annual`
This event is where all the carbon transfers are applied for each simulation year. Disturbances are matched to the correct records, and the transfers listed [here](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/index.html#order-of-operations) are applied. Details on transfer rates are found in the [following section, below](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/cbm_core.html#carbon-transfers). While undisturbed cohorts will continue to grow by one time step according to their associated growth curve, disturbed cohorts will only begin growing again after a delay period. This delay is dictated by the `default_delay_regen` parameter of the [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) module, and can be changed by the user. Only growth-related carbon transfers are affected by this delay. By default it is set to 0 years. 

#### `accumulateResults`
This event is where outputs are saved. In the case of our example in Saskatchewan, we output and save [cbmPools](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#cbmpools) and Net Primary Production ([NPP](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#net-primary-productivity-npp)) for each simulation year. If paths are kept at default when running the global script, these outputs will be found here: `~/GitHub/spadesCBM/outputs`. 

#### `plot`
This final event is where all plotting occurs. Plots will be saved as `.png` files in the project's outputs folder. Similar to in `accumulateResults`, if paths are kept at default when running our example global script, these outputs will be found here: 
`~/GitHub/spadesCBM/outputs`. You can also view examples of these plots [here](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/example-spadescbm-in-saskatchewan.html#viewing-results).

### Stands and Cohort Groups

[Cohort groups](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#cohort-groups) are unique combinations of age, growth curve (which equates to species as there is one growth curve per leading species in CBM), [spatial unit](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#ecozone-vs-spatial-unit) and [ecozone](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#ecozone-vs-spatial-unit). In spadesCBM, forested pixels are simulated and represent a stand. Each stand (or pixel) can have one or many cohorts. All cohorts across stands that share an identical age, growth curve, spatial unit, and ecozone will share one unique `cohortGroupID` number. 

The object `allPixDT` is a large table with a row corresponding to every pixel in the [`masterRaster`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#masterraster). The  `cohortDT` object is a long-form table where each simulated pixel (or stand) has its own row (no NAs), and `cohortGroups` lists only the cohort groups and their attributes. In our example there are 1 347 529 pixels simulated (i.e., 1 347 529 rows in `cohortDT`) which are grouped in 739 `cohortGroups` for processing (i.e. 739 rows in `cohortGroups`). 

### Carbon Transfers

Default parameters for simulations are available mainly from [default `.csv` files](libcbm/resources/cbm_exn) with a few pieces of information such as `mean_annual_temperature` used in decay rates calculations, `return_interval`, `min_rotations` and `max_rotations` used in the `spinup` or initialization process available in an [SQLight database](https://github.com/cat-cfs/libcbm_py/tree/main/libcbm/resources/cbm_defaults_db).  There are 18 internal carbon pools in [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) (see Table 1 in Overview), and two pools that take carbon out of the system, one for the atmosphere and one for harvested wood exiting the system. Disturbances are the first carbon transfer to be applied to each record. Half the annual increment is then added (transfer from the atmosphere to the three above ground biomass pools - `Merch`, `Foliage`, and `Other`). Disturbance inputs are processed externally to [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git). In our example disturbances are processed in [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git), leaving [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) free of spatial data manipulations. Disturbance matrices specify the proportion of carbon in each pool to be transferred to other pools or to be taken out of the system (via forest products (pool named `Products`) or back to the atmosphere). Figure 1 gives an example of transfers during a fire in Saskatchewan. 

*Figure 1: Proportional carbon transfers between pools during a fire in Saskatchewan*

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM/main/manual/images/SKfireAlluvial.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

The amount of carbon transferred from the atmosphere to the above ground biomass pools is determined from the growth curves, which were translated from $m^3/ha$ to carbon increments in [CBM_vol2biomass_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_vol2biomass_SK.git) and provided to [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) in carbon increments (in tonnes of carbon/ha). In our example the object `simMngedSK$growth_increments` has the increments used for the simulation. Dead Organic Matter ([DOM](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#dead-organic-matter)) turnover happens next and transfers carbon from the pools representing snags (`StemSnags` and `BranchSnags`), to the `MediumSoil`, and `AboveGroundFastSoil` pools. Biomass turnover follows with transfers from the `Merch`, `Foliage`, `Other`, `FineRoots` and `CoarseRoots`, to the pools representing the snags (`StemSnags` and `BranchSnags`), `AboveGroundVeryFastSoil`,	`BelowGroundFastSoil`, `AboveGroundVeryFastSoil` and `BelowGroundVeryFastSoil pools`. Carbon is never lost in the system, but increments are at times negative.  To accommodate negative increment values, a carbon transfer labelled `overmature_decline`, moves carbon between the `Merch`, `Other`, `Foliage`, `CoarseRoots` and `FineRoots` to pools representing stem an branch snags, and the `AboveGroundFastSoil`, `AboveGroundVeryFastSoil`, `BelowGroundFastSoil`, and `BelowGroundVeryFastSoil` pools. The transfers are portioned in the same way as the annual turnover and the amount is equal to the loss of each individual biomass pool according to the negative increment. Following the `overmature_decline` transfers, the second half of the growth is added to the three above ground biomass pools - `Merch`, `Foliage`, and `Other`. Next, the transfers due to decay are performed. Applied decay rates ($a_k$) are calculated for each DOM pool($_k$) as per **Equation 1** (see @kurz2009). 

**Equation 1.** 
$a_k = D_k * TempMod * StandMod$

Where:

$D_k$ is the base decay rate (yr−1) at a reference mean annual temperature ($RefTemp$).

$TempMod$ is a temperature modifier, as per **Equation 2**,  and $StandMod$ is a stand modifier as per **Equation 3** (@kurz1999).

**Equation 2,**

*TempMod = *$e^{((MAT_i -RefTemp) * ln(Q_{10}) * 0.1)}$

Where:

$MAT_i$ is the mean annual temperature of each spatial analysis unit.

$RefTemp$ is the reference mean annual temperature. 

$Q_{10}$ is a temperature coefficient.


**Equation 3.**

$StandMod =  1+(max_r - 1) * e^{(-b * TotBio/MaxBio)}$

Where:

$max_r$ is the open canopy decay rate multiplier (default value of 1).

$TotBio$ is the total aboveground biomass, $MaxBio$ is the maximum aboveground biomass for the specified stand type, and 

$b$ is a reduction factor calculated such that at 10% of maximum biomass, decomposition rates are reduce by 50% (set at 6.93 see @kurz1999).

The default values for base decay rate ($D_k$), $RefTemp$, $Q_10$ and $max_r$ for [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) simulations are found [here](https://github.com/cat-cfs/libcbm_py/blob/main/libcbm/resources/cbm_exn/decay_parameters.csv). 

The final carbon transfers represents the physical transfer rate from the above- to belowground slow pool and is set at of 0.006 yr−1 ([`slowmixing`](https://github.com/cat-cfs/libcbm_py/blob/main/libcbm/resources/cbm_exn/slow_mixing_rate.csv)) is based on the transfer rate for dissolved organic C reported in the literature for some Canadian forest soils (@moore2003).

The amount of carbon in the `CoarseRoots` and `FineRoots` pools depends on the carbon in the three above ground pools that absorb carbon from the atmosphere, `Merch`, `Other`, and `Foliage`. The total root biomass is estimated using empirical equations, one set of equations for hardwood (**Equation 4, 6, 7, 9**) and one for softwood species (**Equation 5, 6, 8, 10**) (@kurz2009, @li2003).

**Equation 4.**

$T_{hw} = hw_a * ((Merch_{hw} + Foliage_{hw} + Other_{hw}) * 2)^{hw_b}$

**Equation 5.**

$T_{sw} = sw_a * ((Merch_{sw} + Foliage_{sw} + Other_{sw}) * 2)$

**Equation 6.**

$P_{fine} = frp_a + frp_b * e^{((-1/frp_c)*(T_{hw} + T_{sw}))}$

**Equation 7.**

$FineRoots_{hw} = T_{hw} * P_{fine}$ 

**Equation 8.**

$FineRoots_{sw} = T_{sw} * P_{fine}$ 

**Equation 9.**

$CoarseRoots_{hw} = T_{hw} * (1-P_{fine})$ 

**Equation 10.**

$CoarseRoots_{sw} = T_{sw} * (1-P_{fine})$

On-going work to improve [CBM](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#cbm-cfs3-vs-spadescbm) is targeting all [DOM](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#dead-organic-matter) related parameters.  @hararuk2017 used data assimilation methods which brought improvements to the turnover rates to the `FineRoots` pool, but no change to the `CoarseRoots` pool. The allocation of carbon between above ground biomass (`Merch`, `Foliage`, and `Other`) to the roots (`FineRoots`, `CoarseRoots`) implemented in [CBM](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#cbm-cfs3-vs-spadescbm) dates from the model development (@kurz2009, @li2003). Other methods for estimating below ground biomass from above ground have been implement to estimate carbon elsewhere (example @harris2021), and a user would be justified in wanting to explore the effects of changing these parameters (@błońska2022). In this R-based environment implementation and improvement of [CBM](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#cbm-cfs3-vs-spadescbm), a user is free to change any of the parameters provided to the `cbm_exn_spinup()` and `cbm_exn_step()` Python functions.


## Outputs

[CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) provides outputs as prescribed in the global script, the script that controls simulations. We make use of the function [SpaDES.project::setupProject](https://spades-project.predictiveecology.org/articles/i-getting-started.html#understanding-spades-projects-main-function-setupproject). While it is possible to develop a [SpaDES]() project using different methods more familiar to the user, the [SpaDES.project](https://spades-project.predictiveecology.org/) package streamlines this process, facilitating a clean, reproducible and reusable project setup for any project. In our example, we specify in the [`globalSK.R`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM/blob/main/globalSK.R) script that we want [`NPP`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#net-primary-productivity-npp) and [`cbmPools`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#cbmpools) saved every year (lines 54-56). A user could specify outputs for any pools (see Table 1 in [Overview](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/index.html#pools)). A user can also chose the outputs they would like to see from all objects in the [simList](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#simlist). For example, a user my have interest in the quantity (in tonnes of carbon) of forest products and emissions existing the system. Our [simList](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#simlist) is named `simMngedSK` (line 61 of our global script [`globalSK.R`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM/blob/main/globalSK.R)), so the object of interest would be `simMngedSK$emissionsProducts`.

Note that [CBM](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#cbm-cfs3-vs-spadescbm), like CBM-CFS3, does not simulate photosynthesis or autotrophic respiration. Therefore, [NPP](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#net-primary-productivity-npp) is calculated as the sum of net growth (i.e., growth that results in positive increment) and growth that replaces material lost to biomass turnover during the year. In young, actively growing stands, a large proportion of [NPP](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#net-primary-productivity-npp) results in positive growth increment while in older, mature stands, a larger proportion of [NPP](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html#net-primary-productivity-npp) is allocated to replacement of material lost to turnover.
